# PulsarFileExplorer
<h3>A simple File Explorer app to traverse through device directories, open files, rename files, and much more.</h3>
<p>My phone did not support Dark Mode and when I tried using it's default file explorer app at night time, I was blinded by the bright white. That's when I thought "Why don't I give a shot at creating my very own file explorer?" Unlike other file explorer apps, I wanted to keep it simple and yet provide many essential features. Now here we are. This is a work in progress. Expect more features and improvements soon.</p>
<p>Java File API is used for all file operation use cases.</p>
